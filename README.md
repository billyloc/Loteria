# Loteria
*****In progress****** - Wanted to build an online game of Loteria (Basically mexican Bingo) that my family in mexico always plays. Wanted to find a way where we can play the game together online. I found one site that has something similar but they charge $30, so I figured I would make the game myself. 

The intention is you will go to the page, enter your name number and choose cell carrier, then choose amount of players -  it will then generate a main game session, then send out links for the entered players and they will go to a page either desktop or mobile (Responsive) and it will be their game card. 

Game deck will show and popup the current card then you can select your pieces if you match and then goal of the game is to completed cover your game card in order to win.
